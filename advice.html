Stitch only after wound is clean; stitching must be limited to seaming the lips of the wound only.<br><br>

    <h3>deases that can be transmitted from animals to human :</h3>

<h4>1- Toxoplasmosis</h4>
<p> One of the most common diseases that can be transmitted from cats to humans is toxoplasmosis, toxic plasma disease, or Toxoplasmosis. 
    Toxoplasma is one of the<span><br><br></span> most common and common parasites in cats, which can be found in feces of cats and then can be transmitted to humans. Although this disease does not represent a significant risk for<span><br><br></span> humans in general, 
    but it is one of the most dangerous diseases for pregnant women .. 
    In the event of this disease during pregnancy, it may cause serious complications for the fetus and <span><br><br></span> its growth. Therefore, pregnant women should be cautious when dealing with cats by washing hands and avoiding handling cat feces.</p>
    <h4>2-Cat scratch disease</h4>
    <p>Humans can develop this disease if they are scratched or bitten by cats or licked into open wounds, which leads to the transmission of a bacterial infection to humans causing swelling in<span><br><br></span> the affected areas and full of pus, with the possibility of fever and headache. 
        Generally, these symptoms go within a few days, and antibiotics may be required. To avoid this disease, you<span><br><br></span> must constantly trim your pet's nails, and not play violently with them.</p>
        <h3>deases that can be transmitted from human to animal :</h3>
        <h4>1- Parotiditis (mumps)</h4>
        <p>Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease in humans.
         The initial symptoms of the disease include lethargy, muscle pain, headache and fever, usually followed by painful swelling of the<span><br><br></span> parotid salivary glands, located on both sides of the face.
            This disease is widely bought among children, but it may nevertheless affect a person of any age and of any gender
            Also, this <span><br><br></span>disease is prevented by vaccination with ease.
            And if a person has mumps, he will recover within a week or two, but in some cases the virus can cause serious complications such as<span><br><br></span> hearing loss, pancreatitis, testicles, ovaries and the brain.
            If the dog becomes infected with this infection, symptoms of the disease are treated so that the body can resist it and thus recover<span><br><br></span> from it. Most dogs recover from a mumps infection in five to ten days.</p>
   
    <h4>2-Salmonella bacteria</h4>
    <p>While salmonella is often associated with food poisoning, its transmission to humans is very possible through contact with infected animals, and vice versa.
        
        In both humans and dogs,<span><br><br></span> salmonella can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headache and abdominal cramps.
        
        Young children and the elderly are more likely to have complications from Salmonella infection.<span><br><br></span>
        
        In order to prevent salmonella, you should prevent the dog from drinking from the toilet or messing with litter boxes, especially while walking the dog, so we always recommend that you<span><br><br></span> put a protective mask during the dogs' walk.
        
        Because salmonella is linked to food, it is necessary to adhere to washing hands continuously, as well as to ensure the safety of food before<span><br><br></span> serving to the dog.</p>
